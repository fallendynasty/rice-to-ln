# rice-to-ln

Takes LN charts from osu mania and converts them into rice charts so actually the repository name should be ln to rice and this is a misnomer lol

HOW TO USE THIS VERY IMPORTANT <br>

download python first ☠️<br>
click code and download as zip and unzip the python script <br>
create a folder to put this python script into <br>
copy and paste the .osu files you wanna convert into rice only into this folder<br>
run the python script <br>
copy and paste the new .osu files (they have the name [no ln]) into their original folders<br>

make sure you delete everything else besides in the python script in the folder after using it if not funny things may happen (not a problem anymore!)

how to use now:
download python first ☠️<br>
click code and download as zip and unzip the python script <br>
run the python script and select the file and you're done!

note: i will improve this when i learn how to 
- somehow get all the relavent libraries compiled and make a .exe
- create a GUI that will accept files and automatically put them back into the original folder like trippin's rate changer (done!) or even better, make something like funorange's rate changer that automatically detects stuff
